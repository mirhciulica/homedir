"""cache_clean - a simple python script to clean up the /var/cache/pacman/pkg directory.
More versatile than 'pacman -Sc' in that you can select how many old versions
to keep.
Usage: cache_clean {-p} {-v} <# of copies to keep>
  # of copies to keep - (required) how many generations of each package to keep
  -p - (optional) preview what would be deleted; forces verbose (-v) mode.
  -v - (optional) show deleted packages."""
# Note that the determination of package age is done by simply looking at the date-time
# modified stamp on the file. There is just enough variation in the way package version
# is done that I thought this would be simpler & just as good.
# Also note that you must be root to run this script.
